### Course 1 - Intro to Vue 2
`vue-mastery/intro-to-vue-2/`

Since I already have some experience with VueJS I've decided to create a project inspired in the course's project, not following by the book.

The project consists in a page that displays one product and it's details. The user can also add the product (with the selected properties) into his cart.

In this course I used:

* HTML
    * Basic HTML code
* Javascript
    * VueJS (as a simple instance)
* CSS
    * Using BEM's metodology
